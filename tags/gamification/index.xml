      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Melbourne&amp;rsquo;s White Night 2014, we set out to illustrate the dataset of the Melbourne Bike Share scheme. Each docking station of the scheme reports the number of available docks on a (near) real-time basis. We tracked this data over several month and overlaid it on a grid-like representation of the Hoddle grid - those were the ghosts ðŸ‘». A wifi router was setup to allow members of the public to control PacMan from their phone, eat (healthy) fruit  along the Melbourne laneways and avoid these pesky ghosts by predicting the most used bike routes in the CBD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
