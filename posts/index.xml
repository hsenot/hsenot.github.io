      <description>&lt;p&gt;In these troubled times, there is still the possibility of doing good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world needs more people working on the hard problems - climate, health, democracy - and fewer on ads, betting, crypto, trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More open source. Re-useable components standing on the shoulder of previous generations, transparent and accountable.
More 3rd places to continue weaving community fabric. Repair cafes, libraries, bike workshops, &amp;hellip;
Shorter food loops. Closing the distance between producers and consumers. Everyone becoming producer themselves.
More participation in democratic process than just the ballot box. Participatory budgets, community decision-making, &amp;hellip;
Less energy needed. Better insulated houses, services closer to home.
Lower carbon transport options. 3rd vehicles (hybrid car/bike), electric bikes for local journeys, &amp;hellip;
Low-tech solutions.
Circular economy at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
