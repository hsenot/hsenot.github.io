The study developed a roll-out strategy for the provision of on-street parking bays based on a hierarchy of parking bay suitability as a function of net solar potential and existing supply deficit.

The product of this study could be used by policymakers and planners to inform decision-making regarding the provision of EV charging points across the District.
