Developed while studying Sustainable Energy Systems at RMIT, and with the help of a social entrepreneurship grant from RMIT Social Entreprise group, this platform aims at visualising data that by-large remains invisible in our society: energy data.

These visualisations are linking the personal - smart meter data - to the collective - national energy market and solar data. Smart meter data can be uploaded to the platform for an interactive heatmap visualisation, revealing patterns and anomalies.

The empower.me platform is a collaboration with [PureElectric](https://www.pure-electric.com.au/)'s [Paul Szutser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulszuster).
